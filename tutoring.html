							<h4>💻 Website redesign and development</h4>
							<br>

							<h3><strong> 💡 Overview </strong></h3>
							<p><strong><a href="https://bobtutor.org/about-us" target="_blank">Build Our Bridge Academy</a></strong> is a non-profit organization dedicated to offering free tutoring in English, Math, Science, Coding, Music, and Art to underprivileged students from countries all over the world. 								I volunteered as a tutor for the organization throughout high school, and this summer, I worked with two other former leaders to redesign and build a new website for them.
								<br>
								<br> The aim of this project was to enhance usability and improve the overall user experience, focusing on time-keeping and messaging features for students and tutors, while also considering scalability and ease of maintenance for the future. 
								We are currently in the development stage of the project, using React and Django to implement the website.</p>
							<h3>🔆 Roles</h3>
							As a UX Designer and Full-Stack Developer for the website redesign, I was responsible for enhancing both the design and functionality of the platform. I created a visually appealing, user-friendly interface that improved navigation and usability, 
							with a focus on time-keeping and messaging features. 
								<br>
								<br>
								<strong>🛠 Tools & Methodology:</strong> <br>  ✦ User Research <br>  ✦ Figma <br>  ✦ Wireframing <br>  ✦ User Flow Mapping <br>  ✦ Low-Fi Prototyping <br>  ✦ Hi-Fi Prototyping <br>  ✦ HTML/CSS/Javascript
								<br>
								<br>
	
							<h3>🌱 Current Website Experience</h3>
							The existing website, while functional, had several pain points that hindered its effectiveness, including a disorganized user interface and tedious navigation. Key functions like time-keeping and messaging were difficult to use, and 
							there were many unnecessary features—such as sales reports, pricing, and reviews—built into the user dashboard, despite there being no practical use for them.

							<h3>👥 User Research</h3>
							To better understand the users' needs, I surveyed current students, tutors, and leaders to gather their opinions on specific aspects of the website and their overall user experience. Through the survey, I sought to collect insights 
							that would guide the redesign process and ensure the new website would include improved features that cater to users' preferences and needs.

							<p style="float:right; margin-right:10px;"><p><strong>🔧 Survey Focus Areas:</strong>
								<br>❓ Overall satisfaction with the current website
								<br>❓  Usage patterns for time-keeping and messaging features
								 <br>❓ Specific pain points with current functionalities
								<br>
								<br>
								<strong>🌟 Survey Results & Insights:</strong><br>
								<br> ⏱️ Time-keeping was the most used feature, while the messaging system was rarely utilized
								<br> 📅  There was a lack of an automatic date range selection and issues with incorrect display
								 <br> ⭐ There was a need for fewer unnecessary features and a simplified interface
								<br>
								<br>
						
							<h3><strong> 🖋️ Design Ideation and Wireframing</strong></h3>
							<p>	I redesigned the landing page and information sections to be more welcoming and informative, with clear navigation to key sections such as registration and login. 
								This new user flow ensures that visitors can easily find and access the features they need with minimal clicks. I used Figma to create low-fidelity wireframes that 
								map out the structure of the new website, focusing on ease of use with a clean layout and intuitive structure.

							<h3><strong> 💫 Final Design </strong></h3>
							<p>I then refined the low-fidelity wireframes into high-fidelity versions that included graphics, various forms of content, and visual hierarchy.

							<h3><strong> ✅ Student and Instructor Profiles </strong></h3>
							<p>I designed the new dashboard to streamline the user experience by focusing on the most-used features: time-keeping and messaging. 
								The time-keeping feature was enhanced to include a more simplified date and course selection process, while the messaging system was redesigned to be more user-friendly and accessible.

							<h3><strong> Development & Launch</strong></h3>
							<p>	After finalizing the high-fidelity wireframes, we moved on to developing the website using React, Vite, and Django.
								 We are currently in the process of building the website and plan to launch it in the next few months after thorough testing.
